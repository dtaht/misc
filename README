Misc tools

I've written a lot of little tools over the years, but had lost
'em all. I just need a safe place to store them. Intended for this
dir are:

- foot - an interface to a footpedal
- stagger - stagger processes over an interval
- rtb - read that back - speech synth interface

Whenever I get around to working on them again.
